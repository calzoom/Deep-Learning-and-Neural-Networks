# Deep Learning

This repository will contain my work from the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) that was created by *deeplearning.ai* and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing be completing my coursework in Python3 and use Tensorflow.

## About This Specialization

The specialization develops the foundations of Deep Learning, including building neural networks, and learning how to lead successful machine learning projects. The specialization covers Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. The courses are supplemented with case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. Completion of the Specialization highlights mastery in not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry.  

# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## In this course I will:

### Showcase my fluency of the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
### Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
### Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
### Display understanding of the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
